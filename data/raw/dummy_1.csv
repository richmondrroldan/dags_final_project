The Philippines has backed out from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) due to questionable metrics and procedures, the Department of Finance (DOF) said Wednesday.
In an emailed statement, the DOF said Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III informed EITI Chairman and former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark of the decision in a letter dated June 20, 2022.
We find that the manner by which the EITI Board undertakes its Validation is unduly subjective, biased, and unfair, the letter read.
The Philippines has no confidence in the ability of the EITI to undertake an impartial, transparent, and evidence-based Validation process, Dominguez added in the letter.
The DOF chairs the Philippine Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (PH-EITI), which governs the implementation of the EITI in the country.
The EITI is an international initiative where member countries commit to disclose inflation involving the extractive industry value chain, and agree to a common set of rules governing what has to be disclosed and when.
The EITI Board earlier this year said the Philippines only partly met the implementation, citing the need to improve the environment for civil society participation.
Validation identified supposed instances of intimidation of civil society activities and journalists in the Philippines, adding that these are possibly linked to interventions or positions on issues concerning extractive investments.
The conclusion of the Validation assessment, that Requirement 1.3 was partly met reflects serious concerns relating to the breaches of the civil society protocol, Clark said in February.
The corrective actions are both urgent and necessary. The decision to revisit application on the safeguard mechanism in October is an indication of the Boards intent to actively monitor the situation, she added.
For its part, the DOF said it has repeatedly sought the details of the supposed issues on civic space to allow the government to address these, but was not supplied with details by the EITI.
It also called out the EITI for its supposed lack of due process, and for imposing actions on the Philippines that allegedly violate its sovereignty.
We refuse to be taken hostage by unverified allegations from foreigners and people who have no mandate from the electorate, Dominguez said.
The government will continue to champion better resource and revenue management, and ensure that resource utilization remains open, accountable, and responsive to the needs and aspirations of Filipinos, he continued.
The Mining and Oil Index of the Philippine Stock Exchange closed Wednesday at 11,399.17, down by 94.22 points or 0.82%. The main PSEi lost 117.19 points or 1.86% to close at 6,168.00. RSJ, GMA News

Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos Jrs economic policy chief has dismissed concerns the new administration in the Philippines will be prone to the corruption and mismanagement that proliferated under the president-elects father.
Benjamin Diokno, who serves as the countrys central bank governor and is set to become finance secretary pending confirmation next month, also said the Philippines was positioned to grow its way out of the debt it incurred during the Covid-19 pandemic and would not need to raise taxes in the administrations first year in office.
My appointment itself is a sign that there will be a major departure from the accusation that there will be cronyism, Diokno, a veteran economist and policymaker, told the Financial Times.
He said Marcos Jr has put in place a team that is not political and I dont see any hint of cronyism. I am very confident that he wants to put up a team that will really solve many of our problems involving poverty, involving the economy, involving our debt problem.
Marcos Jr, the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, will be sworn in on June 30. He won a six-year term last month with the help of a social media campaign that opponents said misrepresented the economic record of his father, whose final years were marked by stagnation, corruption and misuse of state funds.
During Marcos Srs two decades in power, he plundered billions of dollars worth of state assets, according to Philippine officials who have tried to recover it after his 1986 ouster in a popular revolt. The family has maintained that they obtained their wealth legitimately.

After giving few details on his policies while campaigning, Marcos Jr eased concerns in the business community when he named Diokno, who also served in then-president Corazon Aquinos administration, as head of his economic team.
Peter Mumford, an analyst at Eurasia Group, said in a note published last week that Marcos had named credible, experienced people for many important cabinet positions and appeared intent on preventing his family or the other political dynasties backing him from having too much power.
Marcos Jrs vice-president is Sara Duterte, daughter of Rodrigo Duterte, the outgoing president.
The Philippines, like most other big economies in the region, is rebounding strongly as it reopens after strict lockdowns imposed during the pandemic. However, government debt has ballooned after the country battled one of south-east Asias heaviest Covid caseloads and borrowed heavily to keep citizens and companies afloat through lockdowns.
I think what I want to do is to keep the growth momentum going during the entire term of the president, and I think growth will solve a lot of our potential problems, Diokno told the FT.
The countrys public debt to gross domestic product ratio of about 64 per cent was not really scary and pretty manageable, he said.
The Philippine economy grew by 8.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021 and we expect the second quarter to be even higher, Diokno said.
Growth would be curbed by the war in Ukraine and the global slowdown, he conceded, but on an annual basis we expect the economy to grow between 7-8 per cent this year and 6-7 per cent for the next five years.
Carlos Dominguez, the current finance secretary, said last month that it was critical that the next administration undertook a fiscal consolidation plan to reverse within 10 years an additional 3.2tn pesos ($59bn) of debt incurred by the government during the pandemic.
Diokno confirmed that he planned to present a five or six-year medium-term fiscal programme next month that would be exactly the same plan that is handed over to us by Secretary Dominguez.
However, he added: It will not necessarily be focused on raising new taxes because we honestly believe the outgoing president is handing over a much superior tax system to what he inherited.
Recommended
As with Marcos Jr, Duterte  a populist strongman whose term was marked by harassment of critics and a drugs crackdown that killed thousands  had left the management of the economy mostly in the hands of non-political technocrats.
Reforms pursued during Dutertes term included an overhaul of the tax system under which levies on cigarettes and sugary drinks were sharply raised, while income taxes were cut and administration was improved.
A law passed in March allowed foreign investors to fully own companies in sectors such as airports, expressways and railways.
While not ruling out tax rises, Diokno said there would be maybe no [new] tax for the first year of this administration.
He added: I am going to focus on keeping the growth momentum going, because I truly believe a strong economy would bring in more revenues.

The future may yet be bright for the Philippines.
Despite the ongoing pandemic and months-long nationwide lockdown, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) sees  rosy economic growth for the Philippines next year.
In an interview with ANC on May 20, ADB senior economist James Villafuerte said the international lender is optimistic about a quick recovery in 2021 for most Asian countries, including the Philippines.
That's because we expect a very bad economic outcome this year which means that theres much opportunity for growth next year, said Villafuerte. I agree, theres room for a strong bounce-back for the Philippines next year.
The Philippine economy has shrunk for the first time in 22 years,  0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2020. The recession was triggered by stringent lockdown measures in Luzon and the temporary closure of businesses amid the pandemic.
BSP Anticipates 7 to 8 Percent Growth in 2021
On May 18, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) governor Benjamin Diokno made a similar forecast, saying the country is likely to see a 7 or 8 percent economic growth next year, despite the banks projected economic contraction of 2 to 3.4 percent this year.

By next year, we are anticipating a growth of seven to eight percent, and thats the consensus among international organizatons, said Diokno in the interview.
Diokno cited the countrys healthy fiscal position, local banks buffering, and economic and tax reforms which will help keep the economy afloat in 2021.

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is likely to implement back-to-back policy rate hikes in a bid to ease the continuous inflationary uptrend in the country, the DBS Group Research said in its latest flash note.
According to economist Chua Han Teng, the central bank could raise the policy rates by 25 basis points when it meets on Thursday, June 23, with another follow-up hike scheduled on August 18.
An economy that is recovering from the pandemic amid looser virus restrictions means that extreme pandemic-era accommodation is no longer needed, the research note said.
The BSP will be keen to temper rising inflation expectations to keep in line with its price stability mandate, and avoid falling behind the curve, it added.
The central bank already raised hikes by 25 basis pointsfor the first time since 2018 last month, bringing the overnight reverse repurchase facility to 2.25%, the overnight deposit facility to 1.75%, and the overnight lending facility to 2.75%.
Inflation then stood at
5.4%
, marking the fastest reading in over three years since it clocked in at 5.2% in December 2018. This compares with the 4.9% in April, and 4.1% the same month last year.
The latest reading is also higher than the BSPs target range of 2% to 4% for the second straight month, which DBS Research believes to continue for some more months.
Domestic monetary tightening however would do little to tackle imported inflation driven by global supply-side disruptions, the research note said.
It flagged the possible impact of the depreciation of the Philippine peso against the US dollar, noting that it is weakening in the fastest annual pace in about five years.
The Philippine peso hit the P54:$1 levelon Monday, marking its weakest close in over three years, attributed to the latest remarks of the US Federal Reserve indicating further rate hikes.
A weakening peso might fan imported inflation at a time of elevated global commodity prices, and in turn stoke higher inflation expectations and second-round effects, which the BSP would want to contain, DBS said.
Energy Undersecretary Gerardo Erquiza Jr. on Monday said domestic pump prices could reach P100 per liter should the weekly increases continue.
Oil firms on Monday announced another hike in pump prices reflecting the third straight week of increases in the country. Prices have so far been on an uptrend for most of the year.AOL, GMA News

Incoming Socioeconomic Planning secretary and National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) chief Arsenio Balisacan said Tuesday the Philippines' agriculture sector is already in crisis.
In a television interview, Balisacan was asked if there is already a food crisis in the Philippines. He then cited the soaring prices of rice and meat products as well as the ""low profitability"" in farming, which has depicted the dilemma in the agriculture sector.
""Food crisis have risen already and as you know the Avian Flu, this problem has been with us that has led to grippling price increases of meat, rice prices have also been a problem that while the tariffication has brought down the cap of prices quite a bit, they are still high and the issues that concern farmers, the low profitability of rice farming in agriculture and farming in general have to be faced so with that I would say that our agriculture is in crisis,"" he said in an interview with CNN Philippines.
Asked if the situation will get worse, Balisacan said this could continue in the coming months as other nations are already eyeing to adjust the quantity of their export products for the benefit of their citizens.
""Some of the exporting countries are now planning to limit their exports to also protect their citizens from the prices. Many countries including us are going to address these realities by increasing their production,"" he said.
With these issues in the agriculture sector, Balisacan stressed the need to protect the poor and vulnerable sector, noting that they should be given the assistance they need in these difficult times.
He reiterated the remark of President-elect Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. that ramping up the process of the issuance of the National ID will help in the speedy distribution of assistance to the poor.
""Ang sa akin ang pinakauna (For me, the first thing), the rapid increase in price is already here and likely to get worse before they even get better. So we must protect the poorest and vulnerable groups in our society. We have to strengthen 'yung ayuda natin, but this time make sure the ayuda will go to the serving groups and not just to anyone,"" Balisacan said.
Balisacan's remark came after Marcos announced that he would sit as Agriculture secretary ""for now,""saying that he is giving high priority to the issues besetting the said sector.
Marcos said he wants to increase food production in the Philippines and restructure the Agriculture department.AOL, GMA News

The Philippines central bank does not see stagflation as an immediate risk to the economy and is optimistic recovery will be sustained, its governor said on Thursday.
Central banks across Asia are under pressure to tighten policy rates to tame inflation, though the move risks stunting growth and increasing unemployment.
A steady upturn in credit activity, ample domestic liquidity and improving labor market conditions will help boost economic activity, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno said in a statement.
The BSP will remain vigilant over emerging price and output conditions and will undertake necessary action to ensure that monetary policy settings remain appropriately calibrated, Diokno

The Philippines has signalled another rate increase for its June 23 policy meeting as risks to the inflation outlook tilt toward the upside for both 2022 and 2023.

Amid concerns from rising commodity prices, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) on Thursday allayed fears that the Philippine economy will fall under stagflation.
Stagflation is an economic condition characterized by slow growth, high unemployment, and rising inflation.
In a statement, the BSP said that stagflation is not an immediate risk to the Philippine economy.
The BSP is optimistic that the Philippine economy will sustain its recovery given the stronger-than-expected GDP growth of 8.3% in the first quarter of 2022, the central bank said.
The war between Russia and Ukraine has been causing global crude oil prices to skyrocket, resulting in the increase in domestic pump prices for net importing countries such as the Philippines.
The rise in fuel and transport cost caused inflationto accelerate to 5.4% in May, with quicker spikes seen on the prices of vegetables, meat, and fish.
However, the BSP said that the steady upturn in credit activity, ample domestic liquidity, and favorable market sentiment should also help boost economic activity.
The central bank added that consumer confidence has improved in the first quarter of 2022, while the countrys foreign direct investments (FDI) yielded net inflows in March.
Albeit at a 10-month low, the countrys FDI stood at a net inflowof $72 million in March, 9.8% lower than the $806 million recorded in the same month last year and the $893 million recorded in February.
Domestic labor conditions also continue to improve, with employment now approaching pre-pandemic levels following the easing of COVID-related mobility restrictions and sustained vaccination efforts. From a peak of 17.6% at the height of the pandemic in April 2020, the unemployment rate was down to 5.7% in April 2022, the BSP said.
The central bank noted that while domestic inflation is seen to remain elevated in the near term, as a result of supply-side factors linked to volatile global commodity prices, inflation is expected to revert to the government's target range of 2% to 4% by 2023.
In the meantime, the balance of risks to the inflation outlook now leans toward the upside for both 2022 and 2023, it said.
Given these considerations, the BSP reiterates its support for urgent and coordinated efforts of government agencies to ensure adequate domestic food supply, the central bank said.
It said that direct and targeted interventions made by the national government will be critical in tempering the impact of persistent supply-side pressures on prices and wage-setting.
The BSP will remain vigilant over emerging price and output conditions and will undertake necessary action to ensure that monetary policy settings remain appropriately calibrated, consistent with the BSP's price and financial stability mandates, it added.LDF, GMA News

THE PHILIPPINES should continue offering globally competitive fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to attract more foreign investments that could boost the economy, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) chief said, after a business process outsourcing (BPO) firm decided to give up these perks
to keep its current work setup.
A major source of attracting investors is our globally competitive fiscal and non-fiscal incentives like the ease of doing business and in lowering the cost of doing business especially in our economic zones, PEZA Director-General Charito B. Plaza said in a mobile phone interview with
BusinessWorld
.
(The government) must attract huge capital investments to the country with zero or the least tax to create multiplier effects to the economy, total development and social progress, Ms. Plaza said. Those huge capital investments will develop our lands, bring in new technology, create thousands of jobs and livelihood, grow micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), more businesses, and industries as suppliers of raw and manufactured materials, others as the utilities, facilities and service providers to the principal and sub-industries.
The PEZA chiefs comments came after the Finance departments statement on the decision of BPO firm Concentrix to give up its tax perks in exchange for a continued hybrid work setup.
Finance Assistant Secretary Juvy C. Danofrata last week said that the companys decision shows these incentives are not that important to investors doing business in the Philippines.
Ms. Danofrata, who also heads the Fiscal Incentives Review Board (FIRB) secretariat, added that this move also validates the Finance departments policy thrust to avoid granting unnecessary perks due to its impact on government revenues. The FIRB monitors the tax breaks granted to registered businesses.
She added that some BPO firms have been enjoying these incentives for a long time.
For her part, Ms. Plaza said the FIRBs stance is sending wrong signals that the government is only after taxes.
Successful economies use strategies that provide both fiscal and non-
fi
scal incentives and even provide subsidies to investors. Foreign direct investments and multinational companies who have branches in many countries of the world weigh the e
ffi
ciency factors that contribute in lowering the cost of production, of pro
fi
tability, and in doing business, Ms. Plaza said.
Incentives granted to BPO companies located in economic zones are tied to how much work they perform on-site. The on-site work rules were eased during the pandemic, but the relaxed regime expired in March, mandating all businesses to implement a 100% on-site work arrangement in order to keep their incentives.
On the other hand, the PEZA is allowing its registered firms to implement a 70% on-site and 30% remote work arrangement until Sept. 12, or the end of the declared national state of calamity, as long as they apply for letters of authority.
Under the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) law, companies registered with investment promotion agencies like the PEZA are eligible for perks like an option to pay a 5% special corporate income tax in lieu of other taxes, an income tax holiday, and enhanced deductions.
These incentives are subject to compliance with Section 309 of the Tax Code, which requires that the companys business must be conducted within the geographical boundaries of the zone or freeport in which the project or activity is registered.

Fires first salvo against Thai-Vietnam proposal, says it views New Delhi as an alternative source
Vietnam has fired the first salvo against Thailand and Vietnam plans to set up a rice cartel by lowering the import duty on the Indian cereal from 50 per cent to 35 per cent.
Reacting to the proposal of Thailand and Vietnam, the second and third largest rice exporters in the global market, Fermin Adriano, the under-secretary in the Department of Agriculture, said an executive order has been issued to lower the duty. Manila is considering India as an alternative source of the foodgrain if the South-East Asian nations raised prices and formed a rice cartel, he was quoted by local media.
Raising farmers income
India is the worlds largest rice exporter accounting for about 40 per cent of global exports. Last year, rice shipments from the country topped 21.3 million tonnes, including Basmati rice. The Philippines imposes 50 per cent duty on rice imports from non-ASEAN nations.
On May 30, the Thailand government spokesperson Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana said Bangkok and Hanoi planned to increase the prices of the grain to raise farmers income and gain bargaining power in the global market. One of the reasons for the plans to form the cartel, according to Wangboonkongchana, is that foodgrain prices have been ruling for almost two decades now even as the production cost has increased.
Demand recovery
Both the nations came out with such a thought as the global demand for rice is on the way to recovery, overcoming the impact of the Covid pandemic.
According to the International Grains Council (IGC), India continues to be very competitive in the global rice market with its 25 per cent broken white rice quoting at $342 a tonne during the weekend. Vietnam is quoting $421 for its 5 per cent broken white rice and Thailand $449 for the same grade.
Vidya Sagar VR, Director, Bulk Logix, told
BusinessLine
that Indias 5 per cent broken white rice is quoted at around $340 free-on-board (f.o.b), while parboiled 5 per cent broken is ruling at $350-55 a tonne, 25 per cent broken white rice at $330 and 100 per cent broken at $320-5.
Competitive by over $100/tonne
Rice exports from India are booming now. We are quoting at least $100 a tonne lower than Vietnam and Thailand. China, Vietnam and the Philippines are buying good volumes, he said.
In particular, the Swarna variety rice is being shipped from West Bengal and this is similar to Sona Masuri rice grown in southern parts of India. Even for 100 per cent broken, the Swarna variety is getting preference, Sagar said.
In the domestic market, the modal price (the rate at which most trades take place) of rice is ruling at 1,700-960 a quintal across various agricultural markets in the country against the minimum support price of 1,960 for Grade A paddy.
Govt-to-govt deals
There is no need for India to join such a rice cartel when its share of the global  exports is 40 per cent. India has publicly committed itself to ensure that it would likely to feed the world and doesnt want anyone to go hungry, said S Chandrasekaran, a Delhi-based trade analyst.
This is the third time that Thailand has come out with such a proposal. In 2003, the plan did not take off. In 2008, Thailand wanted to form an organisation of rice exporting countries along with Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar. But the Philippines and Asian Development Bank, although Cambodia backed it. However, the proposal was shunned as the world opinion was against such a cartel.
India has a good chance to export more to the Philippines, said M Madan Prakash, President, Agri Commodity Exporters Association. The government in Manila is looking for government-to-government exports since private traders importing rice are selling it at a higher price, he said.
Even otherwise, enquiries from the Philippines are higher, he said, adding that no purpose would be served by India becoming a part of the cartel. India will have to raise or lower its price as per the cartels decision. This will not help the country in any way, Chandrasekaran said.
Thai, Viet exporters skeptical
The Thailand Rice Exporters also feel that a rice cartel is not a feasible proposition. However, the exporters association has not been taken into confidence over the proposal. Politicians dont understand the rice market and did not discuss this with the association, he said.
The Vietnam Food Association doesnt favour such an association at a time when there is food uncertainty. India has been able to dominate the global trade as it has ample stocks with it and its production is estimated at a record 129.66 million tonnes in the crop year ending this month.
Chandrasekaran said Thailand comes out with such proposals when it faces a crisis. But the situation is different from 2003 and 2008. Trade indication is that this is a government move and not supported by local exporters, he said.
Food security initiative
Meanwhile, The Rice Exporters Association of India (TREA) has launched a food security cooperating initiative with the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Southern Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce along with the Philippines Department of Agriculture and Department of Trade and Industry.
TREA President BV Krishna Rao said through the initiative, India will help Manila to diversify its import basket in tune with what other large importers such as Indonesia are doing. The initiative was proposed by former Indian ambassador to the Philippines Jaideep Mazumdar.
During President Ram Nath Kovinds visit to Manila in October 2019, India had offered its public and private-sector led technical know-how, assistance and investments to improve the productivity of the rice value chain through agri fintech technologies. Besides, it offered help in warehouse receipt financing, predictive natural disaster monitoring and agri mechanisation.

Agriculture Undersecretary Fermin Adriano on Saturday, June 4, 2022, says the Philippines is considering tapping India as an alternative source of rice.
The Philippines is considering India, the worlds top rice exporter, as an alternative source of the commodity should its neighbors in Southeast Asia proceed with their supposed plan to raise rice prices and create a rice cartel, a top official of the Department of Agriculture (DA) said Saturday.
In an interview on Dobol B TV, DA Undersecretary Fermin Adriano said that President Rodrigo Duterte has issued an executive order lowering the tariff on imported rice from India to 35% from 50%.
The rice import duty for countries not part of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is 50%.
Kung magkaganito, may alternative na pagkukunan, Adriano said.
(If this happens, we have an alternative source [of rice].)
A report by Reuters said that Thailands government announced its plan to create a pact with Vietnamto boost their bargaining power and help mitigate rising production costs.
Thailand and Vietnam are the world's second and third largest rice exporters.
The two countries account for 10% of global rice supply, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture.
India, however, accounts for about 40% of the world rice supply.
With this, Adriano said that the planned Thailand-Vietnam rice cartel would be impossible if India will not join the picture.

he pandemic was a stress test for many businesses, regardless of size. While the contagion drove weaker enterprises into insolvency, those which survived became stronger than ever. The pandemic pushed companies to re-imagine, re-invent, re-calibrate, re-set, and re-start their businesses towards greater efficiency. As the worst seems to be behind us, businesses are finally moving out of survival mode and looking to expand again.
But the business environment is fraught with uncertainty. The war in Ukraine continues to choke petroleum and wheat supplies causing price hikes across the globe. Chinas continued lockdown has dampened economic prospects, especially in Asia. Add to this the looming financial crisis among debt-distressed countries like Sri Lanka. In the Philippines, the specter of a new government threatens to change the rules of the game. All these beg the question  What are the prospects for Southeast Asia and the Philippines in the next two years?
BusinessWorld
s recently concluded economic forum provided answers. The bi-annual event features local trailblazers and global thought leaders who provide rhyme and reason to the environment we operate in. The latest installment, entitled Revolutions 2022, was no different. Its keynote speaker, Asian Development Banks Chief Economist Albert Park, gave us a thorough appraisal of where we are in the recovery curve and what we can expect in the next two years, barring extraordinary events.
As we are very much aware, the Philippines economy rebounded in 2021 with 5.7% growth following a severe contraction of 9.6% in 2020. We were the second fastest growing economy last year due to low base effect and the recovery of consumer demand, fueled by government spending. Singapore was the fastest growing economy in 2021, clocking-in a 7.6% expansion. The entire ASEAN expanded by an average rate of only 2.9% last year, substantially slower than East Asia which grew by 7.6% and South Asia which grew by 8.3%.
Omicron had a minimal effect on ASEAN economies. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) of southeast Asian economies shows that trade and commerce remained generally open and continued to expand despite the wave of infection. Outside the region, China was the most affected, what with its draconian lockdown that is in force until today.
The prognosis for the Philippines is 6% growth in 2022 and 6.3% in 2023. This corresponds to the recently adjusted growth rate of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). ASEAN will grow by 4.9% in 2022 and 5.2% in 2023 with Vietnam leading the charge. Vietnams economy is driven by exports and investments and it is poised to expand by 6.5% and 6.7% this year and next.
Inflation in developing Asia will remain manageable at 3.7% and 3.1% in the next two years which is the lowest in the world. Fortunately, most Asian economies are self-sufficient in rice and are not severely affected by the wheat shortage as Europe and the Americas are. Moreover, developing Asia did not flood their economies with money supply as Europe and North America did.
The Philippines, being a net importer of rice, food supplies and petroleum, will see inflation rise to 4.6% this year. It is seen to taper off to between 2% and 4% in 2023.
As for interest rates, the monetary stance of most ASEAN central banks will be accommodative. It will remain relatively flat as government tries to spur investments.
However, the ADB expressed concern over the budget deficits and elevated debt levels across developing Asia. In the Philippines, the budget deficit was at $33 billion or 8.6% of GDP, which raises red flags. As we move forward, it will be a balancing act for the Marcos government as it controls spending to narrow the deficit while not choking economic expansion.
There is no way out of it, the Philippines and most of developing Asia must increase their tax collection bases, stressed Park. As of last year, the revenue to GDP ratio of the Philippines was 15.5% of GDP, dropping from its peak of 16.9% in 2019. The ADB recommends increasing collection efficiency by clamping down on tax evaders, delinquents, and smugglers. It also recommends a simplified manner of assessment and collection through digitization. The possibility of increasing VAT is not ruled out  neither is the suspension of fiscal incentives granted to certain sectors. Other taxes that can be imposed include environmental taxes, health taxes, progressive income and property taxes. There is a potential to increase tax collection by 3% to 4% of GDP more than current levels.
Not to be overlooked is the need to accelerate non-tax revenues including fresh investments, exports, tourism earnings, and the like.
Business opportunities must be created by the government and this can be achieved by fostering greater economic integration with the rest of the world. For the Philippines, it cannot afford to be left out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
ADB encourages the Philippines to invest more in education. Studies show that for every one year of school closure, the lifetime earnings of affected students are reduced by 8-9%. In the Philippines, that number is doubled, what with our two-year closure because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Female students of impoverished families were most affected. The effect on future GDP is a reduction of 13% per year when the current batch of students enter the workforce.
Investments in the digitization of government offices will bode well for public efficiencies and to curb corruption. Meanwhile, investment in renewable energies is a must as we have made commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to reduce our carbon emissions by 75% by 2030.
Although the worst of the pandemic may be behind us (hopefully), its scars are still very much evident. The next two years will be crucial as we lay the foundations for sustained recovery and growth.

MANILA: Philippines President-elect Ferdinand Marcos gave strong indications that he will maintain continuity in economic policy through his picks for central bank governor and finance minister on Thursday (May 26) by adding familiar faces to his Cabinet.
Marcos announced central bank chief Benjamin Diokno would become his finance minister when he takes office on Jun 30, making way for Felipe Medalla, a current monetary board member, to take over as Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas governor. The two will be tasked with tackling inflation and joblessness.
Still, Marcos inherits a much stronger economy than that of the time of his late father, the dictator overthrown in the 1986 ""people power"" uprising, with debt stock at manageable levels, foreign reserves at record highs, and growth at healthy rates.
""The first priority is always going to be the economy,"" Marcos, 64, said in an interview with his new press secretary streamed on his Facebook page.
""It's still down to jobs, to the increasing prices of commodities, some relief for the business community.""
Marcos faces a delicate balancing act to ensure economic recovery is sustained and rising inflation, driven by politically sensitive increases in rice and fuel costs, is kept in check after he starts his six-year term.
He reiterated a campaign pledge to slash rice prices by more than half to 20 pesos (US$0.38) per kg, but he said the Philippines, one of the world's biggest rice buyers, must continue importing to ensure stable domestic supply.

Philippines Congress proclaims Ferdinand Marcos Jr as next president
Gross domestic product grew by 8.3 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace in three quarters, but a rise in interest rates could weigh on domestic consumption, which is major driver of growth.
The central bank kicked off its monetary tightening cycle, this month, much earlier than expected, to bring inflation back inside its comfort range. Diokno on Thursday said the central bank is looking at another 25 basis points rate hike in its June meeting.
Marcos won this month's election by a landslide, paving the way for a once unimaginable return to rule for the country's most notorious political dynasty. He is almost certain to command a supermajority in Congress, which could reduce obstacles to his economic agenda.
Economists broadly welcomed the appointments to Marcos's team, which also included Manuel Bonoan, tollway unit chief of conglomerate San Miguel Corp, as public works secretary, and Alfredo Pascual, former president of the University of the Philippines, as his trade minister.
Pascual will be required to balance economic relations with top trading partners China and the United States at a time of rising regional competition, with the Biden administration seeking to recoup strategic ground lost under predecessor Donald Trump via a new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.
The appointments indicate further continuity from Marcos, who is expected to expand the economic policies of popular incumbent Rodrigo Duterte, including a largely delayed, multi-billion-dollar infrastructure overhaul.

Reno Gazette-Journal
Three king beds are squeezed together inside a tiny motel room in downtown Reno like a life-size game of Tetris.
Just inches away, people shuffle in and out of a tiny shared bathroom  some in halfway-buttoned work shirts, others still wrapped in towels  with almost assembly line efficiency.
What time is the bus coming? one girl asked in Filipino as she hurriedly buttoned her shirt.
Youll be fine, one man responded.
Just two and a half months ago, both workers were living halfway around the world in the Philippines. On this day, however, they are happily living their slice of the American dream.
Here, in a cramped room of an aging motel built during Jimmy Carters first year in office, six roommates marveled at just how vast their opportunities can be in the United States.
Clark Dixon Ravanes eyes widened with disbelief as the fresh-faced 20-year-old talked about how much money he was making at a local hotel-casino. Ravanes has been busing tables to the tune of $8.25 an hour since coming to America.
In Nevada, Ravanes pay is the minimum wage allowed for jobs that do not provide health benefits. For the young man, however, it is a veritable jackpot.
In the Philippines, Ravanes earned the equivalent of less than $7 working at a hotel. That, by the way, was for one whole day.
Before coming here, one days salary for me in the Philippines was just 340 pesos, Ravanes said. Here, you get to earn that in just one hour!
In two weeks, Ravanes and his roommates  who came to the United States on nonimmigrant J-1 visas  will be back home in the Philippines as the terms of their work-exchange program expire. All six, however, dream of coming back someday and joining the ranks of Americas immigrants.
They are not alone.
From 2014 to 2015, the number of immigrants in the United States rose nearly 900,000 to 43.3 million, according to the American Community Survey. Add second-generation family members to the mix and immigrants and their children comprise nearly 1 in 4 Americans, according to a National Academy of Sciences immigration study released last September.
Fueled by their dreams and the promise of a better life, immigrants continue to make an impact not just on American society and culture but the U.S. economy and its labor force.
Today, immigrant workers comprise a sizable chunk of American industry, including traditional sectors such as construction, agriculture and service occupations. In addition to making up a significant number of technology sector workers, immigrants also helped found several disruptive and high-profile tech companies such as Google, Tesla and Flirtey.
At the same time, immigrants find themselves at the center of a national debate that has only gained strength with the election of President Donald Trump.
Nearly 1 in 5 Nevada workers in 2014, for example, are undocumented immigrants, according to the Pew Research Center. Although undocumented immigrants attract the biggest spotlight, some groups such as  the Center for Immigration Studies  whose data was cited by Trump during his campaign  are also calling for a reduction in legal immigration, citing alleged impacts on job availability and wages for native-born residents as well as social services.
Despite the fierce debate, however, many immigrants continue to eye a new life in America. Ogenloyd Bryan Lopez Silva, a 26-year-old who shared a room with Ravanes at Renos Time Zone Motel, says the reason for the United States allure to immigrants is simple.
America is opportunity to us, Silva said. Here, you can have a nice future.
Eugenio Medina squinted before donning his sunglasses on a scorching 98-degree day in late June.
Medina, known to friends and co-workers by his nickname Henio, developed a reputation in Renos construction circles as a hotshot house framer. On this day, Medina was visiting Renos Skyline neighborhood to inspect the framing job his company was doing on a new home.
Back in 1998, I went to help my brother in construction one weekend, Medina said. I liked it so much that I decided to quit my excavating job and do framing on my own.
Today, the 44-year-old Medina counts himself as an American citizen and a job creator. Medina is one-half of the brain trust for framing and custom home company C&E Builders, which he co-founded with partner Chris York in 2011.
Twenty-four years ago, however, his situation was much different.
One night in 1993, Medina was shivering in the cold as he tried to sleep in the desert during his first attempt to cross the U.S. border. Medina, who described himself as poor but happy at the time, once dreamed of becoming an architect in Mexico. His family, however, could not afford to send him to college and Medina says he was destined to become a struggling laborer there.
Medina decided to leave his home state of Nayarit and pay his cousin $2,450 to act as his coyotaje, or guide across the border.
We got caught twice and sent back to Mexico and we would try again the next day, Medina said. You hear a lot of stories about people getting killed and dying in the desert but I was lucky to make it.
After being caught in the U.S. and deported once more in 1994, Medina would make it back to the United States once again to try his hand at various jobs, including cooking and washing dishes.
Medina, however, wanted more.
I didnt come to the U.S. to be a dishwasher, Medina said.
Medina would find his place in Nevadas construction industry. At first, he only did simple labor on job sites before moving up to operating heavy machinery. As Medinas skill sets and management know-how improved, he was placed in charge of overseeing worker crews.
I saw a lot of opportunities here and went for it, said Medina, who was naturalized in 2001. I decided to stay.
Nevada, which enjoyed an extended run as the fastest-growing state in the nation prior to the recession, remains a popular destination for immigrants. The Silver State looks even more appealing when compared to places such as Arizona, which passed stricter immigration laws, said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Research Center. Arizona saw its undocumented immigrant population peak at 500,000 in 2007 before the recession and tougher laws combined to reduce that number by 40 percent to 300,000 by 2012, the Pew Research Center found.
In Nevada, legal and undocumented immigrants comprise 19 percent of the population, which is significantly higher than the national average of 13.5 percent, said state demographer Jeff Hardcastle. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates Nevadas total population to be at 2.94 million in 2016.
The state also has a more established immigrant population. Nearly 62 percent of Nevadas immigrants entered the country prior to 2000 compared to 56 percent nationally, Hardcastle said.
Nevada also tops the nation in one key metric.

Dictator's son far ahead in Philippine presidential vote
The son and namesake of ousted Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos has taken a commanding lead in an unofficial count in the presidential election in the deeply divided Asian democracy. With 80% of the votes counted, Marcos Jr. had 25.9 million, far ahead of his closest challenger, current Vice President Leni Robredo, a champion of human rights, who had 12.3 million. The next president is likely to hear demands to prosecute outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte for thousands of killings during his anti-drug crackdown. Dutertes daughter, southern Davao city Mayor Sara Duterte, is Marcos Jr.s vice presidential running mate in an alliance of the scions of two authoritarian leaders who concern human rights groups.
Tight Pennsylvania GOP Senate race; Mastriano wins gov nod
Donald Trumps choice for Pennsylvania governor has won his primary, and his Senate pick is locked in an exceedingly close contest as the former president works to expand his hold on the Republican Party. Trumps late endorsement helped put the already surging far-right state senator Doug Mastriano over the top Tuesday in the GOP governors primary in one of the nations premier battleground states. But Mehmet Oz, the celebrity heart surgeon endorsed by Trump, is locked with former hedge fund manager David McCormick in a race that is too early to call. On the Democratic side, progressive Lt. Gov. John Fetterman easily secured his party's Senate nomination.
Russia's claim of Mariupol's capture fuels concern for POWs
Concern is mounting over the fate of Ukrainian fighters who have become Moscows prisoners as Russia claimed full control of the Mariupol steel plant. A separatist leader in eastern Ukraine said nearly 2,500 Ukrainian fighters were in custody and they were sure to face tribunals. Their family members have pleaded for them to be given rights as prisoners of war and eventually returned to Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Ukraine will fight for the return of every one of them. The steel plant for weeks was the last Ukrainian holdout in Mariupol and a symbol of Ukrainian tenacity in the strategic port city.

On Tuesday, the 26-year-old conservative North Carolina firebrand left his election night party early, and a spokesperson told reporters he was conceding the race to state Sen. Chuck Edwards. Cawthorn faced a slew of problems as he sought a second term  many of his own creation. On Monday, former President Donald Trump had urged voters to give him a second chance.
Bad Kitty: German town grounds cats to save rare birds
What a cat-astrophe! Authorities in the southwest German town of Walldorf have ordered some cat owners to keep their pets indoors until the end of August to protect a rare bird during its breeding season. The decree is designed to help save the crested lark which makes its nest on the ground and is therefore easy prey for feline hunters. The birds population in Western Europe has declined sharply in recent decades. The decree has reportedly prompted meows of anguish from pet owners. Regional daily Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung reported Wednesday that the head of the local animal protection association plans to take legal steps to challenge the decree.
Senate ships $40B Ukraine aid bill to Biden for signature
The Senate has whisked a $40 billion package of military, economic and food aid for Ukraine and U.S. allies to final congressional approval. Thursday's 86-11 vote puts a bipartisan stamp on Americas biggest commitment yet to turning Russias invasion into a painful quagmire for Moscow. The legislation was backed by every voting Democrat and most Republicans. At a time of widespread bipartisan gridlock, the lopsided vote signaled unity about sending Ukraine the materiel it needs to fend off Russian President Vladimir Putins more numerous forces. Democrats criticized the 11 Republican opponents, saying they're following former President Donald Trump's damaging isolationist impulses.

And by joining their resistance to Russias onslaught, they hope to weaken both the rule of Russian President Vladimir Putin and that of his ally, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. Volunteers heading from Belarus to fight in Ukraine believe that weakening Putin will create a window of opportunity to topple Lukashenko and bring democratic change to Belarus, a nation of nearly 10 million. One fighter says we understand that its a long journey to free Belarus and the journey starts in Ukraine.

MANILA - The Philippine economy is seeing one of the world's fastest recovery from the impact of the pandemic but the next government should remain prudent to keep the current gains, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Chua said Monday.
The economy expanded by 8.3 percent in the first quarter of 2022, a reversal from the 3.8 percent contraction in the same period last year.
This brings the country closer to its 7 to 9 percent growth target, with the gross domestic product needing to grow just by 6.6 percent in the next 3 quarters to hit the lower end, Chua told ANC.
Thats, I think doable, there are risks as Ive mentioned...We were just hit by the pandemic but we are seeing the biggest bounce back in the entire world The bulk of the growth is going to come from domestic demand and we have to ensure a strong domestic rebound, which we are seeing, he said.
Maintaining strong macro-fiscal position, being prudent, living within our means, raising tax revenues [are crucial] so we can fund the priority spending and infra and human capital, he added.
Philippine economy expands 8.3 percent in first quarter of 2022
Reforms also need to be continued by the next administration to keep the pace of recovery, he said. Some low-hanging fruits are the ""better implementation"" of universal healthcare and the ease of doing business law, Chua said.
But he said the government must keep an eye on looming risks such as the Russia and Ukraine crisis, the slowdown in China's economy and the US' aggressive policy normalization.
Chua said the National Economic and Development Authority has not met the next administration's transition team but they are ready anytime.

F
erdinand Bongbong Marcos Jr. is poised to become the Philippinesnext president after taking a massive leadin the May 9 election. Voters, many too young remember, were partly seduced by the 64-year-olds misleading presentationof his late fathers dictatorial rule as a halcyon economic age to be revived.
In truth, the elder Marcos, a brutal kleptocrat who killed thousands of political opponents and bled state coffers, was a disaster for the Philippine economy. Before his ouster in a 1986 uprising, the dictator used foreign loans to fund an infrastructure bingebuilding, among other things, a nuclear power plant that was never used. The countrys external debtballooned from $599 million at the start of his rule in 1965, to $28.3 billion, or some 80%of the countrys GDP, when he fled into exile. Much of the money went in kickbacks to cronies and Marcos Sr. may have stolen up to $10 billionof the countrys funds. The proportion of the population living below the poverty line grew from 42% before the dictatorship to 59% after.
The younger Marcos
has also promisedshowy projects and pledgedto continue, if not beef up, the Build Build Buildinfrastructural program of outgoing president Rodrigo Duterte, meant to usher in the Philippines golden age of infrastructure. The Marcos camp says it has blueprintsfor the revival of the agricultural and transportation sectors, as well as plans for SMEs. But Marcos Jr. faces undeniable economic obstacles if he is indeed confirmed the election winner and takes office on June 30.

Why the World Should Be Concerned by the Marcos Victory
The Philippine economy grew by 8.3% in the first quarter of this year more than the median 6.8% predicted in a Bloomberg survey which gives him time to get his feet under the desk. However, growth could be undermined if rising inflation curtails consumer spending. The war in Ukraine and COVID-19 lockdownsin China also pose ongoing threats to global markets.
The economic managers are going to be critical in the next several years because of the pandemic and the economic crisis, so that is something that were looking at very carefully, Marcos told reporters on May 11. In line with his central campaign message of unity, he has offered to work with technocrats from across the political aisle.
Markets have certainly made no secretof their preference for Marcos main rival, incumbent vice president Leni Robredoa economics graduate and lawyer with experience in poverty alleviation, rural development, and housing. Some $9.3 billion was wiped offthe Philippine bourse the day after the vote went against her and analysts do not expect a rally until Marcos unveils more detailed plans.

The Marcos legacy
With its choice location on the edge of the South China Sea, the Philippines has been wooed by both the U.S.and China Its sea ports and young population (
nearly 30%
of its 110 million people are between 10 and 24 years old) make it a desirable partnerespecially if it could start to fulfill its economic potential. Whether that will be possible under Marcos remains to be seen. In a report released before the election, investment bank JP Morgan expressed misgivings over Marcos lack of an articulated substantive economic platform and flimsy record in government.
Concern has also been expressed over his proposal to revive some of his fathers economic initiatives, such as an oil price stabilization fund that the state eventually had to subsidize
Marcos tends to bring up many of the programs of his father in the hope of stealing peoples emotions and trying to evoke some false nostalgia about his fathers legacy, says J.C. Punongbayan, assistant professor of economics at the University of the Philippines in Quezon City. A 2021 study coauthored by Punongbayan found that it took 23 years for the countrys per capita GDP to recover from the doldrums of the dictatorships final years.

A Short History of the Rise, Fall and Rise of the Marcos Family
There are fears too that cronyism will make a comeback. Political alliesof the elder Marcos were given top positions in government and other perks, such as loans guaranteed by the government. After his ouster, many of the companies owned by such individuals were unable to service their debts, went bankrupt, and were taken over by the state.
If the second Marcos administration will reassemble this kind of coalition, then it might mean that the Philippine economy will suffer, says political science lecturer Cleve Arguelles at De La Salle University in Manila.
In the meantime, uncertainty prevails. Marcos Jr., says Punongbayan, has failed to really outline a comprehensive and a well researched plan when it comes to the economy.

Newly-elected Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will inherit an economy that has strongly bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic when he takes office in June, but soaring food and fuel costs will need to be addressed quickly.
Southeast Asia's fifth-largest economy grew a better-than-expected 8.3% in the first quarter , the government said on Thursday. It was the fastest annual growth since the June quarter of 2021 when it expanded 12.1% and exceeded a 6.6% forecast in a Reuters poll.
That growth rate made the Philippines the fastest growing economy in the East Asia Region for the period, officials said.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the economy grew 1.9% in January-March from the previous quarter , with the easing of COVID-19 curbs and election-related spending underpinning domestic demand.
That gives the central bank scope to raise interest rates to tackle rising inflation, which threatens to dampen consumer sentiment and derail the economic recovery.
""Since we are doing relatively well on the economic opening as evidenced by the Q1 data, the immediate priority is to address inflation, especially those that affected people the most, food prices,"" Economic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua told a news conference.
The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) holds its next policy meeting on May 19, with some analysts seeing higher chances for an interest rate hike.
""With GDP now back to pre-COVID levels and with inflation accelerating, we fully expect BSP to hike policy rates at the May 19 meeting,"" said ING senior economist Nicholas Mapa.
Economists have raised concerns the BSP, which has kept benchmark interest rates steady since November 2020 at record lows , could fall behind the curve as central banks around the world step up monetary tightening to fight inflation.
Governor Benjamin Diokno, however, has flagged a possible hike in June, with the BSP looking at raising rates two to three times to bring down inflation by next year.
REFORMS AND FISCAL PRUDENCE
To sustain the growth momentum, Chua also urged the next administration to pursue further tax reforms, continue fiscal prudence and boost tax revenues needed to finance infrastructure projects and human capital development.
Boosting tax revenue is crucial as Marcos must tackle the problem of heavy public debt bloated by heavy borrowings to finance the government's pandemic measures.
""A majority mandate on top of sizable political capital opens the door for opportunities for Marcos to implement substantial economic reforms early on in his single six-year term,"" ING's Mapa said.
Marcos, who clinched a decisive victory in Monday's election, said he would hit the ground running as president and was looking very carefully at candidates for his economic team, with infrastructure, jobs and energy prices his priorities.
Another pressing issue is the need to widen face-to-face learning as schools reopen, Chua said, a key challenge for the education department, which will be under the supervision of newly-elected Vice President Sara Duterte-Carpio, daughter of the current president.
Students have faced setbacks due to lack of access to computers and patchy internet during 20 months of online learning.

Manila:The Philippine economy grew a better-than-expected 8.3% in the first quarter, the government said on Thursday. It was the fastest annual growth since the June quarter of 2021 and exceeded a 6.6% forecast in a Reuters poll.
On a seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy grew 1.9% in January-March from the previous quarter, with the easing of COVID-19 curbs and election-related spending underpinning domestic demand.
This could mean newly-elected Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will inherit an economy that has strongly bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic when he takes office on June 30, but soaring food and fuel costs will need to be addressed quickly.
STOCKS DOWN 1.56%
Philippine stocks lost another 1.56% on Thursday, following a post-election sell-off that had already erased as much as 488 billion pesos ($9.3 billion) in value.
The benchmark Philippine stock index dropped amid a global selloff, even as investors awaited economic plans of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. An unofficial count of Mondays vote shows Marcos Jr is headed for a landslide win.
The main stock index edged down to 6,532.30, its lowest close in nine months.
Fastest-growing in region
The Philippines thus was the fastest growing economy in the East Asia Region for the period, officials said.

Rate hike seen

Tax, economic reforms
